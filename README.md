# Battleship

This project is a web-based "Battleship" game I made for "The Odin Project". For this project, I attempted to recreate the game "Battleship" in javascript, employing Test-Driven Design (TDD). Reflecting on my experiences through this project, I realize that my solution here is fairly raw and that I am still lacking in my code organization. As such, I plan to develop these more as I learn more. In the future, I plan to go back to this task to further style it and to reorganize my code.

While working on this project I...

* Learned to used Jest for testing
* Employed Test-Driven Design (TDD) to formulate modules and test logic
* Learned to seperate javascript functionality across different modules
